# Index.js

## How to Install other versions of Jquery
1. Delete the _second_ line of _index.html_ or any other page (.html)

2. Now their are two ways to do it the first I think is much easier:

## 1. Toolkit Install
Goto .js file you wish to use the version on and type at the start: ```indexjs.install("Jquery", "(VERSION URL)");```
replace _VERSION URL_ with the version you want (ex. https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.0.0/jquery.min.js)

## 2. Script Install
Now replace the second line with this: ```<script src="(VERSION URL)"></script>```
replace _VERSION URL_ with the version you want (ex. https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.0.0/jquery.min.js)
